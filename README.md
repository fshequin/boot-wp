Boot-WP
====

A basic Wordpress site framework
----------------------

**Includes:**

1. Twitter Bootstrap distribution files - css, js, glyphicons
2. A style.less starter file that compiles to style.css for starting Wordpress themes
3. A site.js that compiles to a site.min.js file
4. An index.php file as the base index file
5. The Wordpress 3.8 framework
6. A starter theme called "boot", ready for customization
7. I use CodeKit to check and compile the bootstrap and my own custom LESS / JS into the site's working CSS and JS files. The project includes a CodeKit config file that saves project level settings.

**Notes:** 

Clone this repo into any folder, then hook up to the theme folder to CodeKit and your ready to Rock!
